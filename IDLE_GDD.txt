1. Executive Summary
I.D.L.E. (Interstellar Development & Logistics Enterprise) is an idle/incremental game where players build and manage a growing interstellar civilization. Starting from a single colonized home system, players construct facilities, gather resources, manage populations, and send out scouting missions to discover and expand into new star systems.
1.1 Core Pillars
•	Strategic Expansion: Discover and colonize systems with limited construction slots
•	Economic Depth: 12 economy types with layered bonuses and specialization
•	Logistics Gameplay: Manage trade fleets, fuel supplies, and shipping routes
•	Living Systems: Populations grow and decline; system states create dynamic challenges
•	Idle Progression: Rewarding gameplay for both active sessions and passive accumulation
1.2 Core Gameplay Loop
1.	Scout: Send scouts to discover and survey new systems at the frontier
2.	Colonize: Establish presence via supply runs, build initial Trade Outpost
3.	Develop: Construct facilities, grow population, optimize production
4.	Trade: Connect systems via trade routes or sell on galactic market
5.	Expand: Use accumulated resources to push the frontier further
 
2. New Player Experience & Home System

5. Construction System
5.1 Slot Types
•	Surface Slots: Ground-based facilities (mines, farms, factories)
•	Orbital Slots: Space stations (refineries, shipyards, trade stations)
•	Stellar Slots: System-wide facilities orbiting the star (Starport, unique buildings)
Note: Slot limits are hard caps and cannot be expanded through upgrades.
5.2 Construction Cost Formula
cost = base_price × (1.03 ^ distance_ly) × (1.06 ^ facility_count)
Distance	Facilities	Multiplier	Example (100)
5 ly	5	1.55x	155
10 ly	10	2.40x	240
20 ly	20	5.81x	581
30 ly	40	25x	2,500
5.3 Construction Process
Constructions have a base cost equivalent to several hours of play without multipliers. After resources are sourced (from within the system, via trade, or purchased on the galactic market), real-world build time applies. This creates natural pacing for idle gameplay.
 
6. Economy Types
Economy	Focus	Key Outputs
Agriculture	Food production, organics, livestock	Food, Organics, Population support
Mining	Raw material extraction	Ores, Metals, Rare Elements
Industry	Processing and manufacturing	Refined goods, Components
Tech	Research and high-tech production	Electronics, AI Cores
Military	Defense and weapon production	Weapons, Security level
Finance	Credit generation, trade optimization	Better buy/sell spreads
Tourism	Entertainment, luxury experiences	Credits, SoL boost
Medical	Healthcare, biotech	Pop growth, Outbreak resist
Communications	Data networks, coordination	Trade route bonuses
Xeno-Sciences	Late-game alien tech	Quantum Materials
Trade	Commerce hub, market access	Trade routes, storage
Energy: Abstracted. Facilities include 100-year reactor as part of construction.
 
7. Resource System
7.1 Core Principles
•	System-Local: All resources (except Credits) exist only where produced
•	Physical Transport: Moving resources requires trade routes with ships
•	Units: All materials in tonnes (t), rates in tonnes/hour (t/h)
7.2 Tier 1: Raw Resources
Iron Ore, Heavy Metal Ore, Rare Earth Ore, Silicates, Ice, Atmospheric Gases, Exotic Gases, Hydrocarbons, Organics, Livestock
7.3 Tier 2: Refined Resources

7.4 Tier 3: Processed Resources
Structural Materials, Alloys, Polymers, Prepared Foods, Quality Foods, Gourmet Foods, Basic Goods, Medical Supplies
7.5 Tier 4: Advanced Resources
Components, Electronics, Ship Parts, Weapons, Comfort Goods, Pharmaceuticals, AI Cores
7.6 Tier 5: High-Tech Resources
Luxury Goods, Quantum Materials, Xeno-Compounds, Synthetic Minds
 
8. Production & Processing
8.1 Pull-Based Production
•	Downstream facilities "pull" inputs from upstream production
•	Excess production flows to storage automatically
•	No player micromanagement of routing required
8.2 Even Distribution
When multiple facilities need the same input, supply splits evenly. Example: 200 t/h ore with two 200 t/h refineries = both run at 50% capacity.
8.3 Throughput Decay
Stage	Throughput	Effect
Extraction (Raw)	100 t/h base	High output from extractors
Raw → Refined	200 t/h capacity	Can handle 2 extractors
Refined → Processed	160 t/h capacity	~20% surplus to storage
Processed → Advanced	80 t/h capacity	~50% surplus to storage
Advanced → High-Tech	20 t/h capacity	~75% surplus to storage
 
9. Facility Reference
See full facility tables in Sections 9.1-9.7 of detailed specification. Facilities organized by tier: Extraction (T1) → Refining (T2) → Processing (T3) → Advanced (T4) → High-Tech (T5) → Support.
10. Population & Standard of Living
10.1 Overview
Population is tracked per-system (not per-body), representing the total inhabitants across all colonies, stations, and habitats. Body types affect ceiling calculations but people are abstracted as commuting between locations within a system.
10.2 Floor & Ceiling
•	System Floor: Sum of all facility floor values. Minimum viable population.
•	System Ceiling: Sum of (each facility's ceiling × body type multiplier)
•	Current Population: Actual inhabitants, drifts based on pull factors
Population cannot fall below floor. Reaching floor triggers negative system states (Famine, Rioting) but prevents total collapse.
10.3 Facility Population Values
Tier	Floor	Ceiling	Notes
T1 Extraction	50	2,000	Basic workers
T2 Refining	75	4,000	Skilled labor
T3 Processing	100	6,000	Technical staff
T4 Advanced	150	10,000	Engineers, specialists
T5 High-Tech	250	20,000	Scientists, researchers
10.4 Support Facility Population Values
Facility	Floor	Ceiling	Notes
Trade Outpost	25	1,000	Small crew, minimal services
Trade Station	75	3,000	Medium port, shops, services
Trade Hub	150	8,000	Major port, commercial district
Research Center	100	5,000	Scientists, support staff
Security Station	50	2,000	Military/security personnel
Comms Outpost	25	500	Skeleton crew
Comms Station	50	1,500	Technical staff
Comms Hub	75	3,000	Full operations center
Financial Center	75	4,000	Office workers, analysts
Tourism Center	100	6,000	Service industry, hospitality
10.5 Body Type Ceiling Multipliers
Each facility's ceiling is multiplied by its body's type multiplier. Orbital facilities use the multiplier of the body they orbit.
Body Type	Multiplier	Reasoning
Earth-like	2.0x	Perfect conditions, everyone wants to live here
Terraformable	1.5x	Good conditions once developed
Terrestrial/Rocky	1.0x	Baseline, domes required
Metal-Rich	1.0x	Same as rocky, industrial focus
Gas Giant (orbital)	0.6x	Orbital habitats only, less desirable
Star (orbital)	0.5x	Hot, dangerous, minimal comfort
Icy Moon	0.3x	Cold, dark, nobody's first choice
10.6 Population Growth Formula
growth_per_second = base_rate × net_pull_factor × (1 - current/ceiling)²
•	base_rate: 5 people/second (tunable)
•	net_pull_factor: Sum of all pull factors (can be negative)
•	(1 - current/ceiling)²: Capacity dampening - growth slows dramatically near ceiling
Example Growth Rates:
Situation	Net Pull	% of Ceiling	Growth/sec
New colony, lots of room	+1.0	20%	+3.2
Stable system	+0.5	50%	+0.6
Near capacity	+1.0	90%	+0.05
Food shortage	-0.3	50%	-0.4
Famine crisis	-1.0	50%	-1.25
10.7 Pull Factors
Multiple factors combine to create net pull, driving population growth or decline:
Factor	Direction	Trigger
QOL - Food Quality	Up	Prepared Foods (+0.1), Quality Foods (+0.2), Gourmet (+0.3)
QOL - Consumer Goods	Up	Basic Goods (+0.1), Comfort Goods (+0.2), Luxury (+0.3)
QOL - Medical	Up	Medical facilities present (+0.1)
QOL - Security	Up	Security adequate (+0.1)
Resource Abundance	Up	Surplus production beyond consumption
Capacity Gap	Up	Distance below ceiling (diminishing returns)
Facility Demand	Up	Current pop below floor (jobs need workers)
Food Scarcity	Down	Food production barely covers consumption
Ceiling Overshoot	Down	Population above ceiling (gentle push)
10.8 Per Capita Consumption
Population consumes resources linearly. Higher population = more consumption = less exportable surplus.
Resource	Rate per 1,000 pop/hour	Notes
Prepared Foods	TBD	Basic nutrition
Purified Water	TBD	Life support
Basic Goods	TBD	Consumer needs
Actual values TBD via playtesting.
10.9 Production Bonus from Population
System population provides a logarithmic production bonus:
production_multiplier = 1 + log₁₀(system_population / 1,000)
System Population	Multiplier	Notes
1,000	1.0x	Baseline
10,000	2.0x	Small colony
100,000	3.0x	Established system
1,000,000	4.0x	Major hub
10,000,000	5.0x	Megacity system
Design Intent: Logarithmic scaling makes large populations valuable but not game-breaking. A system with 10 million people is powerful, but only 5x better than one with 1,000—not 10,000x.
10.10 Facility Construction & Population
•	When a facility completes, its floor value is added to the system floor
•	If current population < new floor: population instantly set to new floor (workers arrive)
•	If current population ≥ new floor: only pull factors affected (gradual growth)
•	Facility ceiling × body multiplier is added to system ceiling
10.11 Sol Starting Population
Sol begins with 2,000 population. With 13 starting facilities providing a floor of 850, this represents an established home system with room for growth but already functioning as humanity's hub.
11. System States & Events
Systems can enter positive states (Stable, Prosperous, Boom, Gold Rush, Golden Age) or negative states (Disaster Recovery, Famine, Outbreak, Rioting, Insurgency) based on conditions and events.
12. Ships & Fleet Management
12.1 Ship Dimensions
•	Tier: Quality — condition degradation, upgrade ceiling, reliability
•	Size: Capacity — cargo space, speed, fuel efficiency
12.2 Ship Sizes
Size	Capacity	Speed	Fuel/Ton	Landing Req
Light	Low	Fast	Medium	Trade Outpost
Medium	Medium	Medium	Medium	Trade Station
Heavy	High	Slow	Poor	Trade Hub
Bulk	Very High	Very Slow	Best/ton	Trade Hub
12.3 Breakdown System
Condition	Possible Failures	Worst Outcome
> 75%	Minor Mechanical only	Reduced speed, limps home
50-75%	Minor, Engine Failure	Stranded, needs rescue
25-50%	Minor, Engine, Nav Failure	Ship & cargo lost
< 25%	All including Core Breach	Total loss
 
13. Exploration & Scouting
13.1 Scout Ships
•	Range: Default 10ly, upgradeable
•	Must return before relaunching
•	Fuel cost scales with distance
•	Discoveries wait for player return (deferred while offline)
13.2 Scout Mission Process
Scout missions perform both discovery and survey in a single deployment:
6.	Outbound: Travel to frontier, locate new system(s)
7.	Survey: Scan all bodies, map features, identify resources
8.	Return: Deliver complete system data to player
Upon return, player receives full system information:
•	All celestial bodies with types and slot counts
•	Body features (High Metal Content, Fertile Soil, etc.)
•	Resource deposit locations
•	System rarity tier
13.3 Scout Upgrades
•	Speed Modules: Reduce travel time
•	Range Modules: Reach further systems
•	Sensor Modules: Better system quality odds (higher rarity tier chance)
 
14. Colonization System
14.1 Overview
After scouting reveals new systems, players establish presence through colonization missions. This creates a foothold for further development.
Flow: Scout (includes survey) → Colonize → Develop
14.2 Prerequisites
•	System must be scouted
•	Player must have an available cargo ship
•	Origin system must have required resources
14.3 Mission Setup
9.	Select cargo ship (origin determined by ship's current location)
10.	Select target system from scouted options
11.	Select orbital body for Trade Outpost placement
12.	Mission launches
14.4 Colony Ship (Temporary Structure)
A temporary "Colony Ship" is established at the target body:
•	Exists only during colonization phase
•	Accumulates delivered cargo across multiple trips
•	Cannot be interacted with directly
•	Converts to Trade Outpost when requirements met
•	Persists indefinitely if mission is interrupted
14.5 Construction Requirements
Resource	Amount
Steel	100t
Glass/Ceramics	50t
Prepared Foods	100t
Purified Water	50t
Total	300t
Travel time and fuel costs scale with distance. Construction requirements are flat to encourage widespread colonization.
14.6 Delivery Mechanics
•	Ship shuttles cargo in round trips
•	Each trip delivers up to ship's cargo capacity
•	Fuel for round trip consumed from origin system
Ship Management:
•	Ship can be recalled (delivered cargo remains at Colony Ship)
•	Different ship can be assigned to resume
•	Only one ship assigned at a time
•	"Resume Colonization" option available for interrupted missions
14.7 First Colony Protection
The player's first colonization attempt is fully protected:
•	No breakdown rolls during first colony mission
•	Ship and cargo guaranteed safe
•	Ensures successful establishment before RNG applies
•	Subsequent colonizations follow normal ship condition rules
14.8 Completion
When all resources delivered:
•	Colony Ship converts to Trade Outpost (Tier 1)
•	Trade Outpost starts empty (no stored resources)
•	System status: "Colonized"
14.9 Post-Colonization Development
Colonized systems unlock:
•	One-time cargo missions: Deliver construction materials for facilities
•	Facility construction: Build on surveyed bodies using delivered materials
•	Trade routes: Establish regular shipping once production begins
Development priority is player's choice based on body types and strategic goals.
 
15. Supply Transport & Logistics
15.1 Overview
The supply transport system enables resource movement between star systems, supporting system specialization and trade networks. Three mission types exist: one-way missions for ship repositioning or one-time deliveries, round-trip missions for fetch quests, and recurring trade routes for automated ongoing commerce.

Design Philosophy:
•	Ship-centric: Each ship is individually assigned to missions or routes
•	Just-in-time loading: Resources loaded when ship arrives (except one-time missions which reserve upfront)
•	Player agency: Empty cargo legs and inefficient routes are allowed—players choose their own efficiency level
•	System-wide storage: Resources tracked per system, not per individual station

15.2 Storage Model
Resources are tracked at the system level with shared storage pools:
•	Each system has one resource pool per resource type
•	Storage capacity = sum of all trade facility capacities in system
•	Ships can dock at any appropriate-tier station and access the shared system pool
•	Internal distribution is abstracted (implied shuttles/pipelines within system)

Trade Station Storage Capacities:
Tier	Name	Base Capacity
1	Trade Outpost	5,000 t
2	Trade Station	25,000 t
3	Trade Hub	100,000 t

Example: System with 2 Trade Outposts + 1 Trade Station = 35,000t total storage capacity.

15.3 Trade Station Docking Requirements
Trade station tier determines which ship sizes can dock. Requirements apply to BOTH origin and destination—you cannot send a large ship to a small port.

Tier	Name	Ships Allowed
1	Trade Outpost	Light only
2	Trade Station	Light, Medium
3	Trade Hub	All sizes

Validation:
•	Enforced when setting up missions/routes (upfront check)
•	If station tier downgraded after route established, ship may become stranded
•	Player receives warning notification if ship can no longer dock

Design Note: Like real-world shipping, you can't send a Panamax cargo ship to a small fishing village. Large ships require large ports; smaller ships or multiple trips handle distribution to smaller locations.

15.4 One-Time Missions
Flexible cargo delivery for specific needs or ship repositioning. Two variants:

15.4.1 One-Way Mission
Ship relocates to destination permanently.

Setup Flow:
1.	Select idle freighter ship
2.	Origin defaults to ship's current location
3.	Select destination system
4.	Configure cargo: Add resource types and fixed amounts
5.	System validates:
    a.	Origin has sufficient resources
    b.	Origin has sufficient fuel for trip
    c.	Both stations support ship size
6.	Resources and fuel RESERVED at origin immediately
7.	Mission launches

Mission Lifecycle:
1.	Ship status: InTransit
2.	Resources deducted from origin storage
3.	Fuel consumed from origin (calculated for loaded cargo weight)
4.	Ship travels to destination
5.	Ship arrives at destination
6.	Cargo unloaded to destination storage (see 15.4.3 for full storage handling)
7.	Ship status: Idle at destination
8.	Ship available for new mission

Use Cases:
•	Relocating ships to where they're needed
•	One-time bulk deliveries for construction projects
•	Initial supply runs to new colonies

15.4.2 Round-Trip Mission
Ship delivers outbound cargo, optionally fetches return cargo, and returns to origin.

Setup Flow:
1.	Select idle freighter ship
2.	Origin defaults to ship's current location
3.	Select destination system
4.	Configure outbound cargo: Add resource types and fixed amounts
5.	Configure return cargo: Add resource types and fixed amounts (optional, can be empty)
6.	System validates:
    a.	Origin has sufficient outbound resources
    b.	Origin has sufficient fuel for ENTIRE round trip (both legs)
    c.	Destination has sufficient return resources (if return cargo specified)
    d.	Both stations support ship size
    e.	Each cargo direction fits within ship capacity
7.	All resources and fuel RESERVED at origin immediately
8.	Return resources RESERVED at destination immediately
9.	Mission launches

Mission Lifecycle:
1.	Ship status: InTransit (outbound)
2.	Outbound resources deducted from origin storage
3.	Full round-trip fuel consumed from origin
4.	Ship travels to destination
5.	Ship arrives at destination
6.	Outbound cargo unloaded to destination storage
7.	Return cargo loaded from destination storage (already reserved)
8.	Ship status: InTransit (returning)
9.	Ship travels back to origin
10.	Ship arrives at origin
11.	Return cargo unloaded to origin storage
12.	Ship status: Idle at origin
13.	Mission complete

Use Cases:
•	Fetch quests: "Go get 500t Rare Earths from System B"
•	Balanced trades: Deliver food, bring back components
•	Supply runs where origin covers all costs (fuel + return cargo)

Fuel Note: Origin must have enough fuel for both legs calculated at heaviest load (outbound vs return). This simplifies logistics—ship carries all needed fuel from start.

15.4.3 Storage Overflow Handling
When ship arrives at destination to unload cargo, storage may be insufficient:

Scenario: Ship carrying 500t Steel, destination storage has 50t free space.

Behavior:
•	Ship attempts to unload
•	Only 50t can fit in storage
•	Remaining 450t stays on ship
•	Ship status: Idle (with cargo still aboard)
•	Ship cannot accept new missions while carrying cargo
•	Notification: "Storage full at [System]—[Ship] waiting to unload [Resource]"

Resolution:
•	Player must free up storage space (consume resources, upgrade station, sell on market)
•	Ship automatically completes unload when space becomes available
•	Ship then becomes available for new missions

Design Intent: Teaches good logistics planning. Players must ensure destination has adequate storage before sending large shipments.

15.5 Recurring Trade Routes
Automated commerce loops for ongoing resource exchange between systems. Each ship is individually configured with its own route.

15.5.1 Route Setup
Ship-centric configuration flow:

1.	Select idle freighter ship
2.	Choose "Set Up Trade Route"
3.	Origin: Ship's current system (System A)
4.	Select destination system (System B)
5.	Configure outbound cargo (A → B):
    •	Add resource types with fixed amounts per trip
    •	Can be empty (0 resources)
    •	Total must not exceed ship capacity
6.	Configure return cargo (B → A):
    •	Add resource types with fixed amounts per trip
    •	Can be empty (0 resources)
    •	Total must not exceed ship capacity
7.	System validates:
    •	Both stations support ship size
    •	Each direction's cargo fits ship capacity
    •	At least one direction has cargo OR both are empty (empty both = repositioning loop)
8.	Route activated—ship begins first cycle

UI Warning: If both directions are empty, display: "Warning: Empty trade route—ship will burn fuel without delivering value. Useful for repositioning only."

15.5.2 Route Lifecycle (Full Cycle)
Routes repeat indefinitely until player cancels or ship becomes stranded.

Phase 1: At Origin (System A), Preparing Outbound
1.	Ship status: Idle at System A
2.	Check if outbound cargo available (Just-In-Time):
    a.	For each requested resource, check System A storage
    b.	If amount available ≥ requested: Load full amount
    c.	If 0 < amount available < requested: Load partial amount (see 15.5.4)
    d.	If amount available = 0: Ship waits (see 15.5.5)
3.	Calculate outbound fuel cost based on ACTUAL loaded cargo weight
4.	Check if fuel available at System A:
    a.	If fuel available ≥ fuel cost: Consume fuel, proceed
    b.	If fuel available < fuel cost: Ship waits for fuel (see 15.5.5)
5.	Deduct loaded cargo and fuel from System A storage
6.	Ship status: InTransit to System B
7.	Ship travels to destination

Phase 2: At Destination (System B), Unloading and Preparing Return
1.	Ship arrives at System B
2.	Attempt to unload cargo:
    a.	Check available storage capacity at System B
    b.	Unload as much as fits
    c.	If storage full, cargo remains on ship (see 15.5.6)
3.	Check if return cargo available (Just-In-Time):
    a.	For each requested resource, check System B storage
    b.	Load full or partial amounts (same logic as Phase 1)
    c.	If any resource has 0 available: Ship waits
4.	Calculate return fuel cost based on ACTUAL loaded return cargo weight
5.	Check if fuel available at System B:
    a.	If fuel available ≥ fuel cost: Consume fuel, proceed
    b.	If fuel available < fuel cost: Ship waits for fuel
6.	Deduct loaded return cargo and fuel from System B storage
7.	Ship status: InTransit to System A
8.	Ship travels back to origin

Phase 3: Return to Origin (System A)
1.	Ship arrives at System A
2.	Attempt to unload return cargo (same overflow handling as Phase 2)
3.	Repeat from Phase 1 (start next cycle)

Route continues indefinitely until:
•	Player cancels route (see 15.5.7)
•	Ship becomes stranded due to missing fuel/cargo
•	Ship condition drops too low (breakdown mechanics apply)

15.5.3 Just-In-Time (JIT) Loading
Unlike one-time missions, recurring routes do NOT reserve resources upfront. Resources are checked and loaded when ship arrives.

Rationale:
•	Routes are long-lived (days/weeks of real-time operation)
•	Upfront reservation would lock resources indefinitely
•	JIT adds management gameplay—players must ensure steady production
•	Allows dynamic resource allocation across multiple routes

Consequence: Routes may stall if production falls behind consumption. This is intended behavior—players must balance supply and demand.

15.5.4 Partial Loading
When requested cargo amount is not fully available, ship loads what it can and departs.

Example:
•	Route requests 500t Steel per trip
•	System A storage has 300t Steel available
•	Ship loads 300t Steel and departs
•	Fuel consumed based on 300t (actual weight), not 500t (requested)

Exception: If 0t available, ship waits (see 15.5.5). No point making empty trip.

Benefit: Keeps trade flowing even during resource crunches. Reduced cargo = reduced fuel cost.

Advanced Option (Post-MVP): Add "minimum load threshold" setting—ship waits if cargo below threshold. Example: "Only depart if ≥250t Steel available."

15.5.5 Waiting for Resources or Fuel
If ship cannot load required cargo or fuel, it enters waiting state.

Behavior:
•	Ship status: Idle at current system
•	Route remains active but paused
•	Ship automatically resumes when resources/fuel become available
•	No fuel consumed while waiting
•	Notification: "[Ship] waiting for [Resource/Fuel] at [System]"

Resumption:
•	Each game tick, check if resources/fuel now available
•	If available: Load cargo, consume fuel, resume route automatically
•	No player interaction required

Player Options:
•	Cancel route (ship becomes Idle, available for new mission)
•	Manually deliver missing resources via another ship
•	Adjust production at system to meet demands

Design Intent: Routes should be "set and forget" but require proper infrastructure. If player overcommits routes, ships will wait—feedback to adjust logistics.

15.5.6 Full Storage at Destination
When ship arrives with cargo but destination storage is full:

Behavior:
•	Ship cannot unload excess cargo
•	Cargo remains on ship
•	Ship enters waiting state at destination
•	Ship cannot load return cargo until unload completes
•	Route paused until storage space available
•	Notification: "Storage full at [System]—[Ship] waiting to unload [Resource]"

Resumption:
•	Each tick, check if storage space available
•	When space available: Unload cargo, proceed to load return cargo
•	Route automatically continues

Prevention:
•	Destination must consume resources or have adequate storage
•	Players should upgrade trade stations if seeing frequent full storage warnings
•	UI should show storage usage % when configuring routes

15.5.7 Route Cancellation
Player can cancel a route at any time.

Behavior:
•	If ship is InTransit: Ship completes current leg, then becomes Idle
•	If ship is Idle (waiting for cargo/fuel): Ship immediately becomes Idle, route cleared
•	If ship is carrying cargo: Cargo is delivered before becoming Idle (no waste)
•	If ship is waiting to unload due to full storage: Ship becomes Idle with cargo still aboard

Rationale: Complete current leg to avoid wasting cargo/fuel already committed. Clean cancellation.

Post-Cancellation:
•	Ship status: Idle at current location
•	Ship available for new missions
•	No resources returned to origin (already consumed/delivered)

15.5.8 Empty Cargo Legs
Both outbound and return cargo can be empty simultaneously.

Use Case: Ship repositioning—move ship from System A to System B without hauling cargo.

Example:
•	Outbound cargo: Empty (0t)
•	Return cargo: Empty (0t)
•	Ship makes round trips between systems, consuming only fuel
•	Useful for relocating ship or maintaining presence at multiple systems

Efficiency Warning:
•	UI displays: "Warning: Empty trade route—ship will consume fuel without delivering value."
•	Players can proceed anyway (useful for repositioning)
•	No hard block—player agency respected

Design Intent: Allow inefficient choices. Players learn efficiency through experience, not hand-holding.

15.5.9 Multiple Ships on Same Route
Routes are ship-specific, not shared slots.

Behavior:
•	Each ship has its own route configuration
•	Multiple ships can run identical A↔B routes independently
•	Ships do not coordinate or stagger trips automatically
•	Each ship operates on its own cycle

Use Cases:
•	High-volume routes: Assign multiple ships to increase throughput
•	Redundancy: If one ship breaks down, others continue
•	Load balancing: Spread cargo across multiple smaller ships vs one large ship

Example:
•	System A produces 2,000t Steel/hour
•	System B consumes 2,000t Steel/hour
•	Assign 4 Medium freighters (500t each) to balance flow
•	Or assign 1 Heavy freighter (2,000t) for bulk delivery

Player choice: Many small ships (faster trips, more flexible) vs few large ships (better fuel efficiency, fewer trips).

15.6 Fuel Consumption
Fuel is consumed from the departure system for each leg of travel.

15.6.1 Fuel Formula
Fuel cost calculated per leg:

fuel_cost = distance × cargo_weight × ship_fuel_efficiency / ship_efficiency_modifier

Where:
•	distance: Route distance in light-years
•	cargo_weight: Actual loaded cargo in tonnes (not requested amount)
•	ship_fuel_efficiency: From ship size definition (Light 0.5, Medium 0.4, Heavy 0.3, Bulk 0.2)
•	ship_efficiency_modifier: Ship upgrade multiplier (default 1.0)

Example Calculation:
•	Distance: 10 ly
•	Cargo: 500t
•	Ship: Medium freighter (efficiency 0.4)
•	No upgrades (modifier 1.0)
•	Fuel cost = 10 × 500 × 0.4 / 1.0 = 2,000t fuel

Empty Cargo: If cargo_weight = 0, fuel cost is minimal (ship still has mass, but abstracted as negligible for gameplay).

15.6.2 Fuel Consumption by Mission Type

One-Way Mission:
•	Fuel consumed from origin system
•	Calculated for loaded cargo weight
•	Consumed at departure

Round-Trip Mission:
•	ALL fuel consumed from origin system (both legs)
•	Calculated for heaviest leg (max of outbound vs return cargo weight)
•	Ship "carries" return fuel from origin
•	Consumed at departure of first leg

Recurring Route (per leg):
•	Outbound leg: Fuel consumed from System A (origin)
•	Return leg: Fuel consumed from System B (destination)
•	Each leg calculated independently based on actual cargo loaded
•	Consumed at departure of each leg

Critical Difference: Round-trip missions consume ALL fuel upfront from origin. Recurring routes consume fuel at each departure point. This means new colonies without fuel production cannot support recurring route return legs—use round-trip missions instead or ship fuel first.

15.6.3 Fuel Shortage Handling
If insufficient fuel available at departure:

Behavior:
•	Ship cannot depart
•	Ship status: Idle (waiting for fuel)
•	Route/mission pauses until fuel available
•	Notification: "[Ship] waiting for [amount] fuel at [System]"

Resumption:
•	Each tick, check if fuel now available
•	If available: Consume fuel, ship departs automatically

Prevention:
•	Ensure origin/destination systems have fuel production
•	Use round-trip missions for new colonies (fuel from origin only)
•	Ship fuel to new colonies before establishing recurring routes

15.7 Travel Time
Travel time calculated per leg:

travel_time_hours = distance / (ship_speed × ship_speed_modifier)

Where:
•	distance: Route distance in light-years
•	ship_speed: From ship size definition (Light 2.0, Medium 1.5, Heavy 1.0, Bulk 0.5 ly/hour)
•	ship_speed_modifier: Ship upgrade multiplier (default 1.0)

Example Calculation:
•	Distance: 10 ly
•	Ship: Medium freighter (speed 1.5 ly/hour)
•	No upgrades (modifier 1.0)
•	Travel time = 10 / (1.5 × 1.0) = 6.67 hours

Cargo Weight: Does NOT affect travel time (engines compensate). Only affects fuel consumption.

15.8 Communications Bonuses
Communications infrastructure improves trade efficiency. Bonuses apply when Comms facilities cover BOTH endpoints of a route.

Facility	Coverage Range	Travel Time	Fuel Cost	Reliability
Comms Outpost	10 ly	-5%	-5%	+5%
Comms Station	20 ly	-10%	-10%	+10%
Comms Hub	30 ly	-15%	-15%	+15%

Coverage Calculation:
•	Check if System A is within range of any Comms facility
•	Check if System B is within range of any Comms facility
•	If BOTH covered: Apply highest tier bonus from either endpoint
•	If only one covered: No bonus (both endpoints required)

Example:
•	System A has Comms Station (20 ly range)
•	System B has no Comms facility
•	Route distance: 15 ly
•	System B is within range of System A's Comms Station
•	Bonus applies: -10% travel time, -10% fuel cost, +10% reliability

Reliability Bonus: Reduces ship breakdown chances during transit (see Section 12.3).

15.9 Ship Status States (MVP)
Ship status determines availability and current activity. MVP uses simplified two-state model:

Idle:
•	Ship is at a system, available for new missions
•	May be waiting for cargo/fuel (route still active but paused)
•	May be carrying cargo if unload failed due to full storage
•	Ship cannot accept new missions while carrying undelivered cargo

InTransit:
•	Ship is traveling between systems OR handling cargo at destination
•	Loading and unloading are instantaneous upon arrival (abstracted)
•	Cannot be reassigned until arrival and cargo handling complete
•	May be on one-time mission or recurring route leg

Post-MVP Ship Status Additions:
•	Loading: Ship at station, loading cargo (adds time delay)
•	Unloading: Ship at station, unloading cargo (adds time delay)
•	Stranded: Ship breakdown, needs rescue (see Section 12.3)
•	Lost: Ship destroyed, route automatically cancelled

15.9.1 Recurring Route Lifecycle (Detailed)
Complete step-by-step flow for a recurring trade route cycle:

Phase 1: At Origin, Preparing Outbound
1.	Ship at Origin (Idle or completing previous cycle)
2.	Check outbound cargo availability (JIT):
    a.	For each requested resource, check origin storage
    b.	If full amount available: Load full amount
    c.	If partial amount available (>0): Load partial, proceed
    d.	If zero available: Ship waits at Origin
3.	Check outbound fuel availability:
    a.	Calculate fuel cost based on ACTUAL loaded cargo weight
    b.	If fuel available: Consume fuel, proceed
    c.	If fuel unavailable: Ship waits at Origin
4.	If waiting (cargo or fuel):
    a.	Ship status: Idle at Origin
    b.	Notification: "[Ship] waiting for [Resource/Fuel] at [Origin]"
    c.	Each tick, re-check availability; resume automatically when met
5.	If proceeding:
    a.	Deduct cargo from origin storage
    b.	Deduct fuel from origin storage
    c.	Ship status: InTransit
    d.	Ship departs for destination

Phase 2: Travel to Destination
1.	Travel time calculated: distance / (ship_speed × modifiers)
2.	Ship arrives at destination

Phase 3: At Destination, Unloading and Preparing Return
1.	Attempt to unload outbound cargo:
    a.	Check destination storage capacity
    b.	If space available: Unload all cargo
    c.	If storage full: Wait with cargo aboard
    d.	Notification if waiting: "Storage full at [Destination]—[Ship] waiting to unload"
    e.	Each tick, re-check storage; unload automatically when space available
2.	After unload complete, check return cargo availability (JIT):
    a.	For each requested return resource, check destination storage
    b.	If full amount available: Load full amount
    c.	If partial amount available (>0): Load partial, proceed
    d.	If zero available: Ship waits at Destination
3.	Check return fuel availability at DESTINATION:
    a.	Calculate fuel cost based on ACTUAL loaded return cargo weight
    b.	If fuel available: Consume fuel, proceed
    c.	If fuel unavailable: Ship waits at Destination
4.	If waiting (cargo or fuel):
    a.	Ship status: Idle at Destination
    b.	Notification sent
    c.	Each tick, re-check; resume automatically when met
5.	If proceeding:
    a.	Deduct return cargo from destination storage
    b.	Deduct fuel from destination storage
    c.	Ship status: InTransit
    d.	Ship departs for origin

Phase 4: Travel to Origin
1.	Travel time calculated
2.	Ship arrives at origin

Phase 5: At Origin, Completing Cycle
1.	Attempt to unload return cargo:
    a.	Check origin storage capacity
    b.	If space available: Unload all cargo
    c.	If storage full: Wait with cargo aboard
2.	After unload complete: Begin next cycle (return to Phase 1)

Route continues indefinitely until:
•	Player cancels route
•	Ship becomes stranded due to prolonged fuel/cargo shortage
•	Ship condition drops too low (breakdown mechanics)

15.10 UI Elements for Transport System
Key UI components needed for implementation:

15.10.1 Fleet View
•	List all ships with current status
•	Filter by: Idle, InTransit, Waiting
•	Show current location, destination, cargo, ETA
•	Quick actions: "Assign Mission", "Cancel Route", "View Details"

15.10.2 Mission Configuration Dialog
Ship-centric flow:
1.	Select ship from fleet
2.	Choose mission type: One-Way, Round-Trip, or Recurring Route
3.	Select destination system (dropdown or galaxy map click)
4.	Configure cargo:
    •	"Add Resource" button
    •	Resource dropdown + amount input
    •	Show running total vs ship capacity
    •	"Remove" button per resource
5.	For round-trip/recurring: Separate sections for outbound and return cargo
6.	Show calculated fuel cost, travel time, ETA
7.	Show warnings: Empty legs, fuel shortage, storage concerns
8.	"Launch Mission" button (validates and confirms)

15.10.3 Active Route Display
For ships on recurring routes:
•	Show route name: "[Ship] → [Origin] ↔ [Destination]"
•	Show outbound cargo config
•	Show return cargo config
•	Show current phase: "At Origin", "Outbound", "At Destination", "Returning", "Waiting for [Resource]"
•	Show trips completed counter
•	"Cancel Route" button

15.10.4 System Storage View
Show per-system storage status:
•	Resource list with current amount and capacity
•	Usage percentage bar (visual indicator)
•	Warning if >80% full
•	Alert if 100% full with ships waiting to unload

15.10.5 Validation Messages
Real-time feedback during mission config:
•	"Insufficient [Resource] at origin" (red)
•	"Insufficient fuel at origin" (red)
•	"Station tier too low for ship size" (red)
•	"Cargo exceeds ship capacity" (red)
•	"Warning: Empty cargo leg—fuel cost with no delivery" (yellow)
•	"Warning: Destination storage may be insufficient" (yellow)
•	"Ready to launch" (green)

15.11 Galactic Market
Instant buy/sell for any resource, no shipping required. Convenience at a cost:
•	Sell price: 75-90% of base value (randomized per transaction)
•	Buy price: 100% of base value
•	Spread: 10-25% lost vs. direct trade
•	Finance economy: Reduces spread (better rates)
•	No fuel cost, no travel time, no ship required

Use Cases:
•	Emergency resource acquisition
•	Dumping excess production when storage full
•	Quick credits when needed
•	Convenience when physical trade is impractical

Design Intent: Galactic market is for convenience and emergencies. Physical trade routes are more efficient for ongoing commerce but require infrastructure and planning.
 
15.12 Integration Notes
The supply transport system shares infrastructure with other game systems:

Shared with Colonization:
•	Ship travel time calculations (distance / ship_speed)
•	Fuel consumption calculations (distance × cargo × efficiency)
•	Ship status management (Idle, InTransit states)
•	Trade station docking requirements (ship size vs station tier)

Shared with Notifications:
•	All waiting states trigger player notifications
•	Prolonged waiting generates reminder notifications
•	Mission completion notifications

Independent Systems:
•	Transport service is independent from colonization service
•	Ships can be used for either transport OR colonization, not both simultaneously
•	A ship on a transport mission cannot be assigned to colonization until mission completes/cancels

Post-MVP Cargo Options:
•	"Fill to capacity": Load as much as available up to ship capacity
•	Percentage-based: "Load 50% of available Steel"
•	Minimum threshold: "Only depart if at least 250t available"
•	Priority ordering: "Load Steel first, then Glass with remaining capacity"

16. Facility Production Trees (Build UI)
16.1 Overview
The Build interface displays facilities organized by production chains in a tabbed view. Each tab shows one resource chain with visual dependency arrows showing input/output relationships.
16.2 Production Chain Tabs
Facilities grouped by primary resource chain:
•	Metals: Mine → Smelter → Alloy Foundry → Component Factory → ...
•	Heavy Metals: Heavy Metal Mine → Heavy Metal Refinery → ...
•	Rare Earths: Rare Earth Excavator → Rare Earth Processor → Electronics Fab → ...
•	Silicates: Silicate Quarry → Glass Works → Construction Yard → ...
•	Gas/Fuel: Gas Collector + Hydrocarbon Extractor → Fuel Refinery → ...
•	Ice/Water: Ice Harvester → Water Purifier → ...
•	Agriculture: Farm → Food Processor → Food Kitchen → Quality Foods → ...
•	Livestock: Ranch → Meat Packing Plant → ...
•	Chemicals: Chemical Plant → Polymer Plant → Consumer Factory → ...
•	Medical: Medical Lab → Pharmaceutical Plant → ...
•	High-Tech: AI Laboratory → Quantum Lab → Synthetic Mind Forge
•	Support: Trade facilities, Research, Security, Communications, Finance, Tourism
16.3 Visual Dependency Display
Each tab shows a tree-style layout with arrows indicating production flow:
Example (Metals Chain):
┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐
│  Mine  │───→│ Smelter │───→│ Alloy Foundry│───→│ Component Factory │
└────────┘    └─────────┘    └──────────────┘    └───────────────────┘
  [Iron Ore]    [Steel]         [Alloys]           [Components]
16.4 Multi-Input Facilities
Some facilities require inputs from multiple chains. These appear in their primary chain with indicators showing cross-chain dependencies:
Electronics Fab requires:
•	Components (from Metals chain)
•	Rare Earths (from Rare Earths chain)
•	Glass/Ceramics (from Silicates chain)
16.5 UI Behavior
•	Clicking a facility shows full recipe and requirements
•	Unavailable facilities (missing prerequisites) shown grayed
•	Built facilities highlighted
•	Hover shows throughput and efficiency stats
•	Cross-chain dependencies shown with different colored arrows or icons
 
17. Technology & Research
•	Tech level is per-system (not shared between systems)
•	Research Centers raise tech level
•	Higher tech unlocks advanced facilities
•	Trade-off: Research Centers consume valuable construction slots
18. Military & Security
•	Security level reduces piracy on trade routes
•	Prevents/suppresses Rioting and Insurgency
•	Contributes to Standard of Living
•	Weapons are tradeable resource, don't directly raise security
19. Naming Conventions
19.1 Systems
Procedural generator with themes: Greek letters + constellation, Catalog numbers, Descriptive names, Mythology, Corporate/colonial.
19.2 Bodies (Arabic Numerals)
•	Planets: {System} {Number} — e.g., "Sol 3"
•	Moons: {System} {Number}-{letter} — e.g., "Sol 3-a"
19.3 Ships
Multiple themes: Nautical, Mythology, Corporate bland, Optimistic, Humorous, Frontier rugged.

•	No offline cap (storage limits natural ceiling)
20.3 Deferred Events
•	Scout returns wait for player to "open"
•	Survey completions queued for player
•	Notifications summarize offline progress
21. Technical Architecture

23. Xeno-Science & Discovery
23.1 Overview
Xeno-Science represents late-game content involving alien artifacts, exotic materials, and technology beyond human understanding. These discoveries only appear far from Sol, rewarding players who push their empire to the frontier.
23.2 Distance-Based Discovery
Xeno-Science content uses distance from Sol to gate discovery chances:
•	0-100 ly: No Xeno-Science discoveries possible
•	100-150 ly: Very rare chance of minor discoveries
•	150-200 ly: Low chance, minor to moderate discoveries
•	200+ ly: Standard discovery rates, full content available
Note: Exact distance thresholds and probability curves subject to balancing.
23.3 Discovery Types
•	Xeno-Compounds: Alien materials found in special deposits or derelicts
•	Alien Artifacts: One-time discoveries that unlock research options
•	Anomalous Systems: Rare star systems with unique properties or resources
23.4 Xeno-Science Economy
Systems can specialize in Xeno-Sciences economy type, which:
•	Processes Xeno-Compounds into usable materials
•	Produces Quantum Materials (AI Cores + Exotic Compounds)
•	Enables Synthetic Mind production (end-game resource)
•	Requires significant infrastructure investment
23.5 Design Intent
Xeno-Science provides a long-term goal that requires substantial empire expansion. Players must maintain supply lines across 100+ light-years, creating complex logistics challenges and rewarding mastery of the game's core systems.
 
24. Prestige System
24.1 Overview
The Prestige system provides a New Game+ loop, allowing players to reset their empire in exchange for permanent bonuses. This extends replayability and gives meaning to long-term progress.
24.2 Prestige Score Calculation
When initiating prestige, a score is calculated from the player's total empire:
•	Storage Tonnage: Total tonnes of all resources across all systems
•	Credits Balance: Current credit holdings
•	Total Population: Sum of population across all colonized systems
Formula: TBD - requires extensive balancing. Target: minimum ~1 week of play for first prestige token.
24.3 Prestige Tokens
Prestige score converts to tokens (name to be workshopped). Token earning scales with empire size:
•	Small empire: Few tokens, slow earning
•	Large empire: More tokens, faster earning rate
•	Incentivizes building up before prestiging
24.4 New Game+ Bonuses
Each token provides small permanent bonuses in subsequent runs:
•	Production Output: +0.1% per token (or less)
•	Ship Speed: +0.1% per token (or less)
•	Research Speed: +0.1% per token (or less)
Design Intent: Bonuses are intentionally tiny. Prestige rewards dedication but doesn't trivialize gameplay. A player with 100 tokens has a 10% advantage, noticeable but not game-breaking.
24.5 What Resets
•	All systems except Sol
•	All resources and credits
•	All ships (reset to starting fleet)
•	Galaxy map (new procedural generation)
•	Sol facilities reset to starting configuration
24.6 What Persists
•	Prestige tokens and accumulated bonuses
•	Achievements/statistics (if implemented)
•	Unlocked knowledge (player skill, not in-game)
24.7 Balancing Considerations
•	First prestige should feel earned (~1 week minimum)
•	Subsequent prestiges should be faster but still meaningful
•	Bonuses must not compound to game-breaking levels
•	Consider diminishing returns or soft caps on total bonus
•	Extensive playtesting required for all values

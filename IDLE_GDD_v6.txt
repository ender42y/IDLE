•	Economic Depth: 12 economy types with layered bonuses and specialization
•	Logistics Gameplay: Manage trade fleets, fuel supplies, and shipping routes
•	Living Systems: Populations grow and decline; system states create dynamic challenges
•	Idle Progression: Rewarding gameplay for both active sessions and passive accumulation
1.2 Core Gameplay Loop
1.	Scout: Send scouts to discover and survey new systems at the frontier
2.	Colonize: Establish presence via supply runs, build initial Trade Outpost
3.	Develop: Construct facilities, grow population, optimize production
4.	Trade: Connect systems via trade routes or sell on galactic market
5.	Expand: Use accumulated resources to push the frontier further

5. Construction System
5.1 Slot Types
•	Surface Slots: Ground-based facilities (mines, farms, factories)
•	Orbital Slots: Space stations (refineries, shipyards, trade stations)
•	Stellar Slots: System-wide facilities orbiting the star (Starport, unique buildings)
Note: Slot limits are hard caps and cannot be expanded through upgrades.
5.2 Construction Cost Formula
cost = base_price × (1.03 ^ distance_ly) × (1.06 ^ facility_count)
Distance	Facilities	Multiplier	Example (100)
5 ly	5	1.55x	155
10 ly	10	2.40x	240
20 ly	20	5.81x	581
30 ly	40	25x	2,500
5.3 Construction Process
Constructions have a base cost equivalent to several hours of play without multipliers. After resources are sourced (from within the system, via trade, or purchased on the galactic market), real-world build time applies. This creates natural pacing for idle gameplay.
 
6. Economy Types
Economy	Focus	Key Outputs
Agriculture	Food production, organics, livestock	Food, Organics, Population support
Mining	Raw material extraction	Ores, Metals, Rare Elements
Industry	Processing and manufacturing	Refined goods, Components
Tech	Research and high-tech production	Electronics, AI Cores
Military	Defense and weapon production	Weapons, Security level
Finance	Credit generation, trade optimization	Better buy/sell spreads
Tourism	Entertainment, luxury experiences	Credits, SoL boost
Medical	Healthcare, biotech	Pop growth, Outbreak resist
Communications	Data networks, coordination	Trade route bonuses
Xeno-Sciences	Late-game alien tech	Quantum Materials
Trade	Commerce hub, market access	Trade routes, storage
Energy: Abstracted. Facilities include 100-year reactor as part of construction.
 
7. Resource System
7.1 Core Principles
•	System-Local: All resources (except Credits) exist only where produced
•	Physical Transport: Moving resources requires trade routes with ships
•	Units: All materials in tonnes (t), rates in tonnes/hour (t/h)
7.2 Tier 1: Raw Resources
Iron Ore, Heavy Metal Ore, Rare Earth Ore, Silicates, Ice, Atmospheric Gases, Exotic Gases, Hydrocarbons, Organics, Livestock
7.3 Tier 2: Refined Resources

7.6 Tier 5: High-Tech Resources
Luxury Goods, Quantum Materials, Xeno-Compounds, Synthetic Minds
 
8. Production & Processing
8.1 Pull-Based Production
•	Downstream facilities "pull" inputs from upstream production
•	Excess production flows to storage automatically
•	No player micromanagement of routing required
8.2 Even Distribution
When multiple facilities need the same input, supply splits evenly. Example: 200 t/h ore with two 200 t/h refineries = both run at 50% capacity.
8.3 Throughput Decay
Stage	Throughput	Effect
Extraction (Raw)	100 t/h base	High output from extractors
Raw → Refined	200 t/h capacity	Can handle 2 extractors
Refined → Processed	160 t/h capacity	~20% surplus to storage
Processed → Advanced	80 t/h capacity	~50% surplus to storage
Advanced → High-Tech	20 t/h capacity	~75% surplus to storage
 
9. Facility Reference
See full facility tables in Sections 9.1-9.7 of detailed specification. Facilities organized by tier: Extraction (T1) → Refining (T2) → Processing (T3) → Advanced (T4) → High-Tech (T5) → Support.
10. Population & Standard of Living
10.1 Overview
Population is tracked per-system (not per-body), representing the total inhabitants across all colonies, stations, and habitats. Body types affect ceiling calculations but people are abstracted as commuting between locations within a system.
10.2 Floor & Ceiling
•	System Floor: Sum of all facility floor values. Minimum viable population.
•	System Ceiling: Sum of (each facility's ceiling × body type multiplier)
•	Current Population: Actual inhabitants, drifts based on pull factors
Population cannot fall below floor. Reaching floor triggers negative system states (Famine, Rioting) but prevents total collapse.
10.3 Facility Population Values
Tier	Floor	Ceiling	Notes
T1 Extraction	50	2,000	Basic workers
T2 Refining	75	4,000	Skilled labor
T3 Processing	100	6,000	Technical staff
T4 Advanced	150	10,000	Engineers, specialists
T5 High-Tech	250	20,000	Scientists, researchers
10.4 Support Facility Population Values
Facility	Floor	Ceiling	Notes
Trade Outpost	25	1,000	Small crew, minimal services
Trade Station	75	3,000	Medium port, shops, services
Trade Hub	150	8,000	Major port, commercial district
Research Center	100	5,000	Scientists, support staff
Security Station	50	2,000	Military/security personnel
Comms Outpost	25	500	Skeleton crew
Comms Station	50	1,500	Technical staff
Comms Hub	75	3,000	Full operations center
Financial Center	75	4,000	Office workers, analysts
Tourism Center	100	6,000	Service industry, hospitality
10.5 Body Type Ceiling Multipliers
Each facility's ceiling is multiplied by its body's type multiplier. Orbital facilities use the multiplier of the body they orbit.
Body Type	Multiplier	Reasoning
Earth-like	2.0x	Perfect conditions, everyone wants to live here
Terraformable	1.5x	Good conditions once developed
Terrestrial/Rocky	1.0x	Baseline, domes required
Metal-Rich	1.0x	Same as rocky, industrial focus
Gas Giant (orbital)	0.6x	Orbital habitats only, less desirable
Star (orbital)	0.5x	Hot, dangerous, minimal comfort
Icy Moon	0.3x	Cold, dark, nobody's first choice
10.6 Population Growth Formula
growth_per_second = base_rate × net_pull_factor × (1 - current/ceiling)²
•	base_rate: 5 people/second (tunable)
•	net_pull_factor: Sum of all pull factors (can be negative)
•	(1 - current/ceiling)²: Capacity dampening - growth slows dramatically near ceiling
Example Growth Rates:
Situation	Net Pull	% of Ceiling	Growth/sec
New colony, lots of room	+1.0	20%	+3.2
Stable system	+0.5	50%	+0.6
Near capacity	+1.0	90%	+0.05
Food shortage	-0.3	50%	-0.4
Famine crisis	-1.0	50%	-1.25
10.7 Pull Factors
Multiple factors combine to create net pull, driving population growth or decline:
Factor	Direction	Trigger
QOL - Food Quality	Up	Prepared Foods (+0.1), Quality Foods (+0.2), Gourmet (+0.3)
QOL - Consumer Goods	Up	Basic Goods (+0.1), Comfort Goods (+0.2), Luxury (+0.3)
QOL - Medical	Up	Medical facilities present (+0.1)
QOL - Security	Up	Security adequate (+0.1)
Resource Abundance	Up	Surplus production beyond consumption
Capacity Gap	Up	Distance below ceiling (diminishing returns)
Facility Demand	Up	Current pop below floor (jobs need workers)
Food Scarcity	Down	Food production barely covers consumption
Ceiling Overshoot	Down	Population above ceiling (gentle push)
10.8 Per Capita Consumption
Population consumes resources linearly. Higher population = more consumption = less exportable surplus.
Resource	Rate per 1,000 pop/hour	Notes
Prepared Foods	TBD	Basic nutrition
Purified Water	TBD	Life support
Basic Goods	TBD	Consumer needs
Actual values TBD via playtesting.
10.9 Production Bonus from Population
System population provides a logarithmic production bonus:
production_multiplier = 1 + log₁₀(system_population / 1,000)
System Population	Multiplier	Notes
1,000	1.0x	Baseline
10,000	2.0x	Small colony
100,000	3.0x	Established system
1,000,000	4.0x	Major hub
10,000,000	5.0x	Megacity system
Design Intent: Logarithmic scaling makes large populations valuable but not game-breaking. A system with 10 million people is powerful, but only 5x better than one with 1,000—not 10,000x.
10.10 Facility Construction & Population
•	When a facility completes, its floor value is added to the system floor
•	If current population < new floor: population instantly set to new floor (workers arrive)
•	If current population ≥ new floor: only pull factors affected (gradual growth)
•	Facility ceiling × body multiplier is added to system ceiling
10.11 Sol Starting Population
Sol begins with 2,000 population. With 13 starting facilities providing a floor of 850, this represents an established home system with room for growth but already functioning as humanity's hub.
11. System States & Events
Systems can enter positive states (Stable, Prosperous, Boom, Gold Rush, Golden Age) or negative states (Disaster Recovery, Famine, Outbreak, Rioting, Insurgency) based on conditions and events.
12. Ships & Fleet Management
12.1 Ship Dimensions
•	Tier: Quality — condition degradation, upgrade ceiling, reliability
•	Size: Capacity — cargo space, speed, fuel efficiency
12.2 Ship Sizes
Size	Capacity	Speed	Fuel/Ton	Landing Req
Light	Low	Fast	Medium	Trade Outpost
Medium	Medium	Medium	Medium	Trade Station
Heavy	High	Slow	Poor	Trade Hub
Bulk	Very High	Very Slow	Best/ton	Trade Hub
12.3 Breakdown System
Condition	Possible Failures	Worst Outcome
> 75%	Minor Mechanical only	Reduced speed, limps home
50-75%	Minor, Engine Failure	Stranded, needs rescue
25-50%	Minor, Engine, Nav Failure	Ship & cargo lost
< 25%	All including Core Breach	Total loss
 
13. Exploration & Scouting
13.1 Scout Ships
•	Range: Default 10ly, upgradeable
•	Must return before relaunching
•	Fuel cost scales with distance
•	Discoveries wait for player return (deferred while offline)
13.2 Scout Mission Process
Scout missions perform both discovery and survey in a single deployment:
6.	Outbound: Travel to frontier, locate new system(s)
7.	Survey: Scan all bodies, map features, identify resources
8.	Return: Deliver complete system data to player
Upon return, player receives full system information:
•	All celestial bodies with types and slot counts
•	Body features (High Metal Content, Fertile Soil, etc.)
•	Resource deposit locations
•	System rarity tier
13.3 Scout Upgrades
•	Speed Modules: Reduce travel time
•	Range Modules: Reach further systems
•	Sensor Modules: Better system quality odds (higher rarity tier chance)
 
14. Colonization System
14.1 Overview
After scouting reveals new systems, players establish presence through colonization missions. This creates a foothold for further development.
Flow: Scout (includes survey) → Colonize → Develop
14.2 Prerequisites
•	System must be scouted
•	Player must have an available cargo ship
•	Origin system must have required resources
14.3 Mission Setup
9.	Select cargo ship (origin determined by ship's current location)
10.	Select target system from scouted options
11.	Select orbital body for Trade Outpost placement
12.	Mission launches
14.4 Colony Ship (Temporary Structure)
A temporary "Colony Ship" is established at the target body:
•	Exists only during colonization phase
•	Accumulates delivered cargo across multiple trips
•	Cannot be interacted with directly
•	Converts to Trade Outpost when requirements met
•	Persists indefinitely if mission is interrupted
14.5 Construction Requirements
Resource	Amount
Steel	100t
Glass/Ceramics	50t
Prepared Foods	100t
Purified Water	50t
Total	300t
Travel time and fuel costs scale with distance. Construction requirements are flat to encourage widespread colonization.
14.6 Delivery Mechanics
•	Ship shuttles cargo in round trips
•	Each trip delivers up to ship's cargo capacity
•	Fuel for round trip consumed from origin system
Ship Management:
•	Ship can be recalled (delivered cargo remains at Colony Ship)
•	Different ship can be assigned to resume
•	Only one ship assigned at a time
•	"Resume Colonization" option available for interrupted missions
14.7 First Colony Protection
The player's first colonization attempt is fully protected:
•	No breakdown rolls during first colony mission
•	Ship and cargo guaranteed safe
•	Ensures successful establishment before RNG applies
•	Subsequent colonizations follow normal ship condition rules
14.8 Completion
When all resources delivered:
•	Colony Ship converts to Trade Outpost (Tier 1)
•	Trade Outpost starts empty (no stored resources)
•	System status: "Colonized"
14.9 Post-Colonization Development
Colonized systems unlock:
•	One-time cargo missions: Deliver construction materials for facilities
•	Facility construction: Build on surveyed bodies using delivered materials
•	Trade routes: Establish regular shipping once production begins
Development priority is player's choice based on body types and strategic goals.
 
15. Trade & Logistics
15.1 Overview
Trade moves resources between systems. Two mission types exist: one-time missions for specific shipments, and recurring trade routes for automated ongoing commerce. This enables system specialization—smaller systems can focus on one production chain and trade for everything else.
15.2 Trade Stations
Trade station tier determines which ship sizes can dock. Requirements apply to BOTH origin and destination—you cannot send a large ship to a small port.
Tier	Name	Capacity	Ships Allowed
1	Trade Outpost	Low	Light only
2	Trade Station	Medium	Light, Medium
3	Trade Hub	High	All sizes
Design Note: Like real-world shipping, you can't send a Panamax cargo ship to a small fishing village. Large ships require large ports; smaller ships or multiple trips handle distribution to smaller locations.
15.3 One-Time Missions
Flexible cargo delivery for specific needs. Two variants:
One-Way Mission:
•	Select ship, origin (ship's current location), destination
•	Configure cargo to deliver
•	Ship travels to destination, unloads, stays there
•	Ship available for new mission at destination
•	Fuel consumed from origin system
Round-Trip Mission:
•	Select ship, origin, destination
•	Configure outbound cargo (origin → destination)
•	Configure return cargo (destination → origin)
•	Ship completes round trip, returns to origin
•	Fuel consumed from origin for entire round trip
15.4 Trade Routes (Recurring)
Automated commerce loops for ongoing resource exchange between systems.
Setup:
•	Select ship, System A, System B
•	Configure A→B cargo (resource type, amount up to capacity)
•	Configure B→A cargo (resource type, amount, or "Nothing")
•	Route repeats indefinitely until cancelled
Behavior:
•	Ship loads cargo at current system
•	Travels to destination, unloads
•	Loads return cargo (if configured)
•	Returns to origin, unloads, repeats
Empty Legs:
•	Either direction can be "Nothing" (empty cargo)
•	Useful for new colonies with no exports yet
•	Inefficient—wastes capacity and fuel
•	Players encouraged to find balanced two-way trades
Multiple Ships:
•	Routes are ship-specific missions, not limited slots
•	Multiple ships can run identical A↔B routes
•	Increases throughput on high-volume routes
•	Ships operate independently (no automatic staggering)
15.5 Fuel Consumption
Each leg of travel consumes fuel from the departure system:
•	One-way mission: Fuel from origin
•	Round-trip mission: All fuel from origin (ship carries enough for return)
•	Trade route (recurring): Each leg from its departure system
Fuel Formula:
fuel_cost = base_fuel × cargo_weight_modifier × distance_modifier
•	base_fuel: Ship-specific fuel efficiency
•	cargo_weight_modifier: Heavier cargo = more fuel
•	distance_modifier: Longer routes = more fuel (slightly exponential)
Important: New colonies without fuel production cannot fuel return trips from trade routes. Either ship fuel to them first, or use round-trip missions from established systems.
15.6 Travel Time
travel_time = base_time × distance_modifier / ship_speed_modifier
•	Light ships: Fastest
•	Medium ships: Moderate
•	Heavy ships: Slow
•	Bulk haulers: Slowest
15.7 Communications Bonuses
Communications infrastructure improves trade efficiency. Bonuses apply when Comms facilities cover BOTH endpoints of a route:
Facility	Travel Time	Fuel Cost	Reliability
Comms Outpost	-5%	-5%	+5%
Comms Station	-10%	-10%	+10%
Comms Hub	-15%	-15%	+15%
Coverage Range: Outpost 10ly, Station 20ly, Hub 30ly. Systems within range benefit from the bonus.
Reliability affects ship breakdown chances during transit. Higher reliability = fewer mishaps.
15.8 Galactic Market
Instant buy/sell for any resource, no shipping required. Convenience at a cost:
•	Sell price: 75-90% of base value
•	Buy price: 100% of base value
•	Spread: 10-25% lost vs. direct trade
•	Finance economy: Reduces spread (better rates)
Design Intent: Galactic market is for convenience and emergencies. Physical trade routes are more efficient for ongoing commerce.
 
16. Facility Production Trees (Build UI)
16.1 Overview
The Build interface displays facilities organized by production chains in a tabbed view. Each tab shows one resource chain with visual dependency arrows showing input/output relationships.
16.2 Production Chain Tabs
Facilities grouped by primary resource chain:
•	Metals: Mine → Smelter → Alloy Foundry → Component Factory → ...
•	Heavy Metals: Heavy Metal Mine → Heavy Metal Refinery → ...
•	Rare Earths: Rare Earth Excavator → Rare Earth Processor → Electronics Fab → ...
•	Silicates: Silicate Quarry → Glass Works → Construction Yard → ...
•	Gas/Fuel: Gas Collector + Hydrocarbon Extractor → Fuel Refinery → ...
•	Ice/Water: Ice Harvester → Water Purifier → ...
•	Agriculture: Farm → Food Processor → Food Kitchen → Quality Foods → ...
•	Livestock: Ranch → Meat Packing Plant → ...
•	Chemicals: Chemical Plant → Polymer Plant → Consumer Factory → ...
•	Medical: Medical Lab → Pharmaceutical Plant → ...
•	High-Tech: AI Laboratory → Quantum Lab → Synthetic Mind Forge
•	Support: Trade facilities, Research, Security, Communications, Finance, Tourism
16.3 Visual Dependency Display
Each tab shows a tree-style layout with arrows indicating production flow:
Example (Metals Chain):
┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐
│  Mine  │───→│ Smelter │───→│ Alloy Foundry│───→│ Component Factory │
└────────┘    └─────────┘    └──────────────┘    └───────────────────┘
  [Iron Ore]    [Steel]         [Alloys]           [Components]
16.4 Multi-Input Facilities
Some facilities require inputs from multiple chains. These appear in their primary chain with indicators showing cross-chain dependencies:
Electronics Fab requires:
•	Components (from Metals chain)
•	Rare Earths (from Rare Earths chain)
•	Glass/Ceramics (from Silicates chain)
16.5 UI Behavior
•	Clicking a facility shows full recipe and requirements
•	Unavailable facilities (missing prerequisites) shown grayed
•	Built facilities highlighted
•	Hover shows throughput and efficiency stats
•	Cross-chain dependencies shown with different colored arrows or icons
 
17. Technology & Research
•	Tech level is per-system (not shared between systems)
•	Research Centers raise tech level
•	Higher tech unlocks advanced facilities
•	Trade-off: Research Centers consume valuable construction slots
18. Military & Security
•	Security level reduces piracy on trade routes
•	Prevents/suppresses Rioting and Insurgency
•	Contributes to Standard of Living
•	Weapons are tradeable resource, don't directly raise security
19. Naming Conventions
19.1 Systems
Procedural generator with themes: Greek letters + constellation, Catalog numbers, Descriptive names, Mythology, Corporate/colonial.
19.2 Bodies (Arabic Numerals)
•	Planets: {System} {Number} — e.g., "Sol 3"
•	Moons: {System} {Number}-{letter} — e.g., "Sol 3-a"
19.3 Ships
Multiple themes: Nautical, Mythology, Corporate bland, Optimistic, Humorous, Frontier rugged.

23.2 Distance-Based Discovery
Xeno-Science content uses distance from Sol to gate discovery chances:
•	0-100 ly: No Xeno-Science discoveries possible
•	100-150 ly: Very rare chance of minor discoveries
•	150-200 ly: Low chance, minor to moderate discoveries
•	200+ ly: Standard discovery rates, full content available
Note: Exact distance thresholds and probability curves subject to balancing.
23.3 Discovery Types
•	Xeno-Compounds: Alien materials found in special deposits or derelicts
•	Alien Artifacts: One-time discoveries that unlock research options
•	Anomalous Systems: Rare star systems with unique properties or resources
23.4 Xeno-Science Economy
Systems can specialize in Xeno-Sciences economy type, which:
•	Processes Xeno-Compounds into usable materials
•	Produces Quantum Materials (AI Cores + Exotic Compounds)
•	Enables Synthetic Mind production (end-game resource)
•	Requires significant infrastructure investment
23.5 Design Intent
Xeno-Science provides a long-term goal that requires substantial empire expansion. Players must maintain supply lines across 100+ light-years, creating complex logistics challenges and rewarding mastery of the game's core systems.
 
24. Prestige System
24.1 Overview
The Prestige system provides a New Game+ loop, allowing players to reset their empire in exchange for permanent bonuses. This extends replayability and gives meaning to long-term progress.
24.2 Prestige Score Calculation
When initiating prestige, a score is calculated from the player's total empire:
•	Storage Tonnage: Total tonnes of all resources across all systems
•	Credits Balance: Current credit holdings
•	Total Population: Sum of population across all colonized systems
Formula: TBD - requires extensive balancing. Target: minimum ~1 week of play for first prestige token.
24.3 Prestige Tokens
Prestige score converts to tokens (name to be workshopped). Token earning scales with empire size:
•	Small empire: Few tokens, slow earning
•	Large empire: More tokens, faster earning rate
•	Incentivizes building up before prestiging
24.4 New Game+ Bonuses
Each token provides small permanent bonuses in subsequent runs:
•	Production Output: +0.1% per token (or less)
•	Ship Speed: +0.1% per token (or less)
•	Research Speed: +0.1% per token (or less)
Design Intent: Bonuses are intentionally tiny. Prestige rewards dedication but doesn't trivialize gameplay. A player with 100 tokens has a 10% advantage, noticeable but not game-breaking.
24.5 What Resets
•	All systems except Sol
•	All resources and credits
•	All ships (reset to starting fleet)
•	Galaxy map (new procedural generation)
•	Sol facilities reset to starting configuration
24.6 What Persists
•	Prestige tokens and accumulated bonuses
•	Achievements/statistics (if implemented)
•	Unlocked knowledge (player skill, not in-game)
24.7 Balancing Considerations
•	First prestige should feel earned (~1 week minimum)
•	Subsequent prestiges should be faster but still meaningful
•	Bonuses must not compound to game-breaking levels
•	Consider diminishing returns or soft caps on total bonus
•	Extensive playtesting required for all values

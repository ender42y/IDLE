GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT
Version 5.0 - MVP Specification
Status: Ready for Development
 
1. Executive Summary
I.D.L.E. (Interstellar Development & Logistics Enterprise) is an idle/incremental game where players build and manage a growing interstellar civilization. Starting from a single colonized home system, players construct facilities, gather resources, manage populations, and send out scouting missions to discover and expand into new star systems.
1.1 Core Pillars
Strategic Expansion: Discover and colonize systems with limited construction slots
Economic Depth: 12 economy types with layered bonuses and specialization
Logistics Gameplay: Manage trade fleets, fuel supplies, and shipping routes
Living Systems: Populations grow and decline; system states create dynamic challenges
Idle Progression: Rewarding gameplay for both active sessions and passive accumulation
1.2 Core Gameplay Loop
1.	Scout: Send scouts to discover new systems at the frontier
2.	Survey: Deploy probes to map discovered systems in detail
3.	Colonize: Establish presence via supply runs, build Trade Station
4.	Develop: Construct facilities, grow population, optimize production
5.	Trade: Connect systems via trade routes or sell on galactic market
6.	Expand: Use accumulated resources to push the frontier further
 
2. New Player Experience & Home System

3. Galaxy Generation & Navigation
3.1 Coordinate System
•	2D coordinate plane with home system at origin (0, 0)

•	Systems placed as discovered, creating expanding "bubble"
3.2 Expansion Pattern
•	First discovery ~5ly from home in random direction
•	New systems placed "outward" from launch point relative to home
•	Creates roughly circular expansion (lopsided based on player choices)
•	Void filling: System tracks density, biases discoveries toward gaps
3.3 Distance Calculations
Distance from home: √(x² + y²) — used for cost scaling
Route distance: √((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²) — used for trade routes

5. Construction System
5.1 Slot Types
Surface Slots: Ground-based facilities (mines, farms, factories)
Orbital Slots: Space stations (refineries, shipyards, trade stations)
Stellar Slots: System-wide facilities orbiting the star (Starport, unique buildings)
Note: Slot limits are hard caps and cannot be expanded through upgrades.
5.2 Construction Cost Formula
cost = base_price × (1.03 ^ distance_ly) × (1.06 ^ facility_count)
Distance	Facilities	Multiplier	Example (100)
5 ly	5	1.55x	155
10 ly	10	2.40x	240
20 ly	20	5.81x	581
30 ly	40	25x	2,500

5.3 Construction
Constructions have a base cost that is equivalent of several hours of play without any multipliers applied to the resources being gathered. This will translate to not actually being that long thanks to factors the players are able to utilize to give multipliers of several times its base rate. After resources are sourced, from within the system, via trade with other systems, or purchased with credits on the intergalactic market, it then will take some real world time to build. Thus slowing play a little, as is the nature with idle games.

10. Population & Standard of Living
10.1 Population Floor & Ceiling
Floor: Each facility raises floor (minimum workers needed)
Ceiling: Based on slots × base pop × modifiers
Drift: Population moves toward equilibrium based on conditions
10.2 Pull/Push Factors
Pull Up: Food surplus, Water, Consumer goods, High SoL, Tech, Security, Medical
Push Down: Shortages, Low SoL, Low Security, Negative states
10.3 Internal Consumption
Populations consume Food, Water, and Consumer Goods. These cannot be exported. Core tension: More population = more production BUT more consumption = less exportable surplus.

11.2 Negative States
State	Trigger	Effects
Disaster Recovery	Random event	Facilities offline, production penalty
Famine	Food shortage	Population decline, unrest risk
Outbreak	Random event	Population decline, may spread
Rioting	Low security + SoL	Production penalty, damage risk
Insurgency	Prolonged rioting	Severe penalties
 
12. Ships & Fleet Management

•	Higher tech unlocks advanced facilities
•	Trade-off: Research Centers consume valuable construction slots
16. Military & Security
•	Security level reduces piracy on trade routes
•	Prevents/suppresses Rioting and Insurgency
•	Contributes to Standard of Living
•	Weapons are tradeable resource, don't directly raise security
17. Naming Conventions
17.1 Systems
Procedural generator with themes: Greek letters + constellation, Catalog numbers, Descriptive names, Mythology, Corporate/colonial.
17.2 Bodies (Arabic Numerals)
Planets: {System} {Number} — e.g., "Sol 3"
Moons: {System} {Number}-{letter} — e.g., "Sol 3-a"
17.3 Ships

•	Real-time production/consumption updates
18.2 Offline Calculation
•	Batch calculation on return
•	Production accumulates (up to storage cap)
•	Overflow auto-sells for credits
•	Trade routes operate normally
•	Population drifts, states may change
•	No offline cap (storage limits natural ceiling)
18.3 Deferred Events

19.2 Game Loop
•	Active: Fast ticks (100-200ms) for smooth number updates
•	Background: Calculate elapsed time on app resume
•	Offline: Batch formulas × time, apply storage overflow
19.3 Architecture Approach
•	Service-based state management with Signals
•	Engine classes for game logic (production, population, trade)
•	Feature modules for UI components
•	Pure TypeScript models shareable with future Node.js backend
19.4 Galaxy Map
